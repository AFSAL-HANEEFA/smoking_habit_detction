The objective of the study was to develop a prediction model using machine learning algorithms that could accurately anticipate if people would smoke in order to obtain health insurance.


I created a dataset of people who were known smokers along with their age, bmi, area, number of children, and sex. After pre-processing the data, I selected and trained a support vector machine model. 

To evaluate the performance of the model, I looked at several factors, including recall, accuracy, and precision. 
Results indicate that the accuracy, precision, and recall for the support vector machine model were 95%, 90%, and 84% respectively.
